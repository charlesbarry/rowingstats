Ronards thoughts
-Link between a rower's profile and the ranking page
-And the text/ranking number can be a link to the ranking page, scrolled so Person's rank is in the centre
-I also would like to generate a bit of chat with "most searched for" and "people also viewed"
-Add an 'In the pipeline' section to the about page (DONE)

Rowers to research:
A Mander (Broxbourne), Ashley Mander (City of Cam)
Freddie Davidson - CUBC/Goldie vs Brookes
NUBC vs Exeter crew - seems wrong
Charlie Evans vs C Evans - UWE and Stratford U Avon
Oliver Arscott  vs Oliver Arscott - one for the twitter feed
Basically all the Met ones need QA'ings
Josh Davidson of Marlow vs J Davidson of Twickenhams
J Anderson - of Putney Town and various others in Brit Champs
A Heath of UWE vs Alfred Heath of Brookes
D Bennett of UWE vs Dominic Bennett of Cambridge 99
J Brown
Was Rob Leech racing for Reading Rowing Club at Fours Head?
