# Rowingstats
This repository provides the codebase for the rowingstats project. This includes the main rowingstats app, plus the blog and other experimental projects.

The website is built using the django python web framework, with of course lots of js on top. The site is hosted on heroku so there are some specific files designed to manage that.
